### Changing PAGE.TSX directory

We are going to use the authentication screen in our main `page.tsx`. But we are moving this file from directory.

1. in the `app` folder, create a new folder called `(site)`. This is the equivalent of an `index` folder. Inside, create a new file called `page.tsx`. Copy all the content from the Main `page.tsx` and paste in in our new `page.tsx``.

2. Now that you have your new `page.tsx`. Go and DELETE the main `page.tsx`.

3. Run your project and it should work =)
